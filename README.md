# Gene-Level Association of Microbiomes (GLAM) - Browser

The GLAM Browser is intended to make it easier to visualize and understand the
results of a microbiome experiment which has been analyzed by whole-genome
shotgun (WGS) sequencing and analyzed with gene-level metagenomic analysis. The
input files for the GLAM Browser are the output files from the `geneshot` analysis
tool ([link](https://github.org/golob-minot/geneshot)).

The GLAM Browser displays:

  * Table of CAG associations (output from corncob)
  * Volcano plot (estimated coefficient vs. -log10(p-value))
  * Table of genes found in a selected CAG
  * Customizable display of CAG abundance across samples
