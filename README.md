# Gene-Level Association of Microbiomes (GLAM) - Browser

The GLAM Browser is intended to make it easier to visualize and understand the
results of a microbiome experiment which has been analyzed by whole-genome
shotgun (WGS) sequencing and analyzed with gene-level metagenomic analysis. The
input file for the GLAM Browser is the output file from the `geneshot` analysis
tool ([link](https://github.org/golob-minot/geneshot)).

Details on how to use the GLAM Browser are found in [the wiki for this repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/glam-browser/wiki).
